# AutoGraph Visualization

This front-end aims to create a interactive interface to present a better way for users to query and understand a knowledge graph in the domain of cars. 

The front-end was developed in vue.js and the underlying database is a popular graph database called neo4j, which provides fast query in graph.

**Under Refactoring!!!**

**This version is a rough but working prototype, functionality is the first priority here, for better code structure, please check the folder autograph_front_end, which use component-based development style and webpack.**
